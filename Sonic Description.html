				<td>Sonic is a male, 15 year-old (20 in real life), anthropomorphic hedgehog. He has spiky blue hair, green eyes, and red and white running shoes with gold buckles. He is only one meter (3ft, 3in) tall (though, in his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, his height is obviously increased). As his name suggests, he is capable of running at supersonic speeds. The self-described "coolest, blue-est hedgehog alive," he has a bit of an attitude and is impatient, but cannot resist helping someone in need.</td>
